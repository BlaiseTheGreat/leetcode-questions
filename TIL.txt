7/20/2021 Data structure best suited for finding the smallest value and inserting
    other values into it is a minheap. heaps are not native to javascript
    so a different language would be better for these problems

7/21/2021 LRU Cache optimal solution for implementing an LRU cache involves 
    a hash table and a doubly linked list the has table will hold the nodes 
    for O(1) lookup time and the linked list hold the structure of which node 
    is first in the list

7/25/2021 Product of array except self
		need to create two arrays, left array will hold the accumulateive
		product of everything from the left of that index, and the right
		array will hold the product of everything from the right of that
		index, then the output array is formed by multiplying those two together
		
		input: [1, 2, 3, 4]

		left:  [1 ,  1, 2, 6]
		right: [24, 12, 4, 1]
		output:[24, 12, 8, 6]

7/25/2021 Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
	make a sliding window from the left, then subtract one from the left and add one from the right
	everytime you subtract/ add one check if you have a new smallest windowl
	FOR ARRAY PROBLEM WITH COMBINING VALUES ALWAYS CHECK IF ITS A SLIDING WINDOW
